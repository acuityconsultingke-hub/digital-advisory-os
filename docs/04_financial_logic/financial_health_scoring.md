# Financial Health Scoring System

## 1. Budgeting
A well-structured budget allows individuals to track their income and expenses effectively. Scoring in budgeting involves assessing the percentage of income allocated to essential expenses versus discretionary spending.

## 2. Savings
The importance of savings cannot be overstated. This pillar focuses on the adequacy of emergency funds, assessing whether they can cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses, as well as the consistency of savings contributions.

## 3. Debt Management
Managing debt is critical for financial health. This pillar evaluates the total debt-to-income ratio and the timely payment of debts to ensure sustainability and reduce financial stress.

## 4. Investment
Investing plays a pivotal role in financial growth. Scoring here involves looking at the diversification of investment portfolios and the understanding of risk versus return on investments.

## 5. Insurance
Having adequate insurance protects against unforeseen events. This pillar assesses whether individuals have the necessary coverage types (health, property, life) and their adequacy based on financial goals.

## 6. Retirement Planning
Planning for retirement is crucial to ensure financial security in later years. This pillar scores the individual's progress towards retirement savings goals and the effectiveness of their retirement plans.
